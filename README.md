#Module 4 Challenge
In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.

##Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
